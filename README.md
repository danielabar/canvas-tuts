## Introduction

Canvas element is bitmap surface that can be manipulated with a JavaScript API. Think of it as a drawing surface.

Once its drawn on, it remains like that until cleared or drawn over. It's just pixels.

Use [RaphaelJS](http://raphaeljs.com/) to replicate canvas behaviour in older browsers.

## Canvas Basics

Must always define width and height for canvas tag, otherwise it resets to default 300x150.

x values start at top left and increase to the right.

y values start at top left and increase down.

Many canvas methods such as `moveTo` and `lineTo` don't do anything until you _commit_ to them via `stroke()`

Lines that are joined together one after the other are referred to as a _path_

If `moveTo` is used between lines, that breaks the path and creates different subpaths

## Lines and Rectangles

Lines can be ended in different styles:

  ```javascript
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  ctx.lineCap = 'butt';   //default
  ctx.lineCap = 'round';
  ctx.lineCap = 'square';
  ```

Lines can be joined in different styles:

  ```javascript
  ctx.lineJoin = 'miter';   // default
  ctx.lineJoin = 'round';
  ctx.lineJoin = 'bevel';
  ```
